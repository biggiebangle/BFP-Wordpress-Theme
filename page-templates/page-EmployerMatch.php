           <p>Many employers offer a "company match" for donations made by an employee to a charity.

			Simply ask your employer if they offer this, and if so, what forms you would need to fill out.

			Usually there is one simple form that the employee fills out and then sends to BFP to complete.

			If your employer currently does not offer a matching program, ask them to start one. Many companies are not even aware this is something they could and should do.

			This is an easy and extremely effective way to double your donation to BFP!</p>
