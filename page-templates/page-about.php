<p><strong>Beagle Freedom Project</strong>, founded in 2010, is a unique program run by the Los Angeles-based non-profit Animal Rescue, Media, and Education (ARME). Beagle Freedom Project negotiates with laboratories across the world to secure the release of dogs and other animals and give them a chance at a normal home life after everything they have endured for vanity and scientific curiosity. </p>
<p>
The organization uses the rescues to draw public attention to the plight of animals languishing in labs and to promote cruelty-free lifestyle choices everyone can make. The beagles act as ambassadors who give faces to animal testing victims and remind the public that these animals are not just furry test-tubes, but dogs no different from their pets.</p>
<p>
To date, Beagle Freedom Project has rescued over 500 beagles, mixed-breed hounds, cats, rabbits, ponies, pigs, goats, guinea pigs, rats, and even goldfish from laboratories. Beagle Freedom Project has given hope and homes to these research survivors in 35 states and 6 countries. Their stories of recovery have been covered extensively by local and national media, such as CNN, NBC Nightly News, HLN, The L.A. Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, Yahoo! News, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post, and many more.</p>
<p>
Beagle Freedom Project has an ambitious immediate and long-term agenda that is both political and pragmatic. The organization is working toward the release of more animals and an end to animal testing altogether. </p>

            Beagle Freedom Project has an ambitious immediate and long-term agenda that is both political and pragmatic. The organization is working toward the release of more animals and an end to animal testing altogether. To actualize this life-saving agenda, the organization focuses on four key programs:
            </p>
           <div class="col-md-6">
           <p>  <span class="background-paw"></span><strong>Rescue and Outreach Center (ROC)</strong>: Often, dogs emerging from prolonged periods of captivity and research violence need special care to address their physical and emotional needs. BFP is constructing a Los Angeles center to initially home these dogs, and to serve as a headquarters and outreach / educational center for the public and press.</p> 
            <p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/wp-content/themes/bfp/img/about/about_roc.jpg" alt="Rescue and Outreach Center (ROC)" /></p>
           </div>
           <div class="col-md-6">
           <p>  <span class="background-paw"></span> <strong>Legislation</strong>: There are 383 labs in the U.S. that use nearly 70,000 dogs every year (of which 96% are beagles). Because so many labs kill the dogs instead of retiring them, BFP is advancing legislation to mandate their release, which will guarantee their freedom and attract positive press attention to this hidden, problematic reality. BFP made history passing this bill into law in California, Minnesota, Connecticut, Nevada, and New York. It is currently pending in Illinois and Maryland.</p>
           </div> 
            <div class="col-md-6">
           <p>  <span class="background-paw"></span><strong>Rescues</strong>: BFP has rescue opportunities on the horizon from labs across the U.S., the UK, Europe, Korea, and even Australia. Each survivor is a living reminder that animals in labs are not abstract. </p>
           </div>
           <div class="col-md-6">
           <p>  <span class="background-paw"></span><strong>Education</strong>: The use of beagles in labs and all animal testing will only end once people are informed. BFP runs nationwide outreach / educational programs to raise awareness of the plight of lab animals and present steps people can take to help stop testing. Via efforts like the <a href="http://www.identitycampaign.org" target="_blank">Identity Campaign</a>, classroom visits, and the BFP Kids Program more and more citizens are learning about animal testing and the non-violent alternatives. </p>

                  <div class="card-block"><strong><span class="primary">A.</span></strong> The rescue varies from lab to lab. BFP reaches out to every lab in the U.S. asking to assist with post-research placements. Some facilities voluntarily work with BFP through animal care technicians and others are compelled to do so because of the Beagle Freedom Law. Often rescues are sensitive and cannot be publicly announced because the labs threaten to kill all future dogs and animals if they see their victims on our website. </div>

They are not house-trained, leash-trained, understand no words, do not have a name, and are completely unfamiliar with toys, furniture, and being outside at all. Every foster is given an exhaustive tip-sheet and given 24 hour support in helping the new dog acclimate to this better life. </div>
