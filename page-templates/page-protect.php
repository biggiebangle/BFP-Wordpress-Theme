            <p>Beagle Freedom Project is calling on the scientific community to "Upgrade Your Research" with innovative, effective, and humane alternatives to animal models and methods. In this way, the Beagle Freedom Project seeks to proactively support ground-breaking research that can yield more relevant, reliable, and predictive data to improve human health.<br><br> Beagle Freedom Project (BFP) will award $250,000 in grants to applicants whose goal is to replace the common use of dogs and other animals in research, testing, and/or education with a non-animal approach, such as <em>in-vitro</em> and <em>in-silico</em> methodologies, amongst others. A total of five possible awards of $50,000 are scheduled, or larger sized grants are available to fewer awardees depending on the nature, merit, and need of the winning proposals.</p>

                <p> Have you always wanted to adopt from Beagle Freedom Project but are still waiting for a lab in your area to finally be freed?</p>
        
                <p>Are you ready to loudly and proudly tell the story of your dog or cat?</p>
        
                <p>Wait no longer! Join BFP's <a href="http://identitycampaign.org/" target="_blank">Identity Campaign</a> and let's get to work.</p>
        
                <p>The <a href="http://identitycampaign.org/" target="_blank">Identity Campaign</a> is a groundbreaking effort to "adopt"  research animals while they are still in the labs.  Instead of waiting for the laboratories to finish their experiments and then decide who lives, who dies, and who can go to a home, we are coordinating a national effort to be proactive  and champion their cause right now.</p>
