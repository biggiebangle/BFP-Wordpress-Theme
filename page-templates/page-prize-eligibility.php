                    <p> The Beagle Freedom Prize is a cash grant given to pioneering scientists and investigative teams working on the development of new technologies and methodologies with the goal of replacing the use of animals in research, testing, and/or education. A total of $250,000 in grant money will be awarded to up to five recipients. After reading the following eligibility guidelines, please visit our <a href="/the_beagle_freedom_prize_application_process"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grant Application</span></a> to begin the submission process.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-muted">Overview and Commitment</h3>
        
        <p><em>All applicants must agree to and understand the following:</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Share the goal to replace the common use of dogs and other animals in research, testing, and/or education with a non-animal method/model.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Non-animal research in this sense means no use of non-human animals (including all vertebrates and invertebrates) or primary animal cells, embryos, tissues, organs, and serums, although the use of established cell lines of non-human animal origin shall not necessarily be excluded. Human biology-based, <em>in-vitro</em>, and/or computer modeling approaches are strongly encouraged.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Understands preference will be given to academic institutions or research groups that deal exclusively with non-animal research.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Award recipients will disseminate the knowledge gained from their research, either in the form of a manuscript submitted for publication in a relevant peer-reviewed journal or a poster presentation at a national scientific conference.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. The proposed research is ongoing and innovative. While other awards (e.g. <a href="http://www.lushprize.org/" target="_blank">Lush Prize</a>) exist to reward successful breakthroughs post-research, these BFP grants will support new and ongoing non-animal research.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. If research is expected to last more than one year an annual report will be required.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. BFP grant policy is one of transparency â€“ all grant winning proposal titles will appear on the <a title="Beagle Freedom Project" href="http://bfp.org/" target="_blank">BFP website</a>. The spirit of this award is to further contribute to the goal of replacing animal testing through collaborative scientific innovation. As such, this will not be a private or protected research project.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-muted">Eligibility Guidelines</h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Beagle Freedom Prize may be awarded to support a new initiative or to sustain existing, promising research. Any person or team wishing to apply for the Beagle Freedom Prize must meet the following minimum eligibility requirements:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. No funds from the Beagle Freedom Prize may be used to support the use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> animals in research. </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. All investigators and research personnel working on the project must have relevant professional qualifications and be affiliated with credible research institutions.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Research proposals must be able to demonstrate a convincing argument as to how the fruits of the project will substantially contribute to the replacement of animals in research. In light of the mission statement of the Beagle Freedom Project, priority will be given to proposals that seek to replace a common use of <em>dogs.</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. At least one representative from each award recipient must be available to present about the project at a Beagle Freedom Prize symposium in January 2017. Exact date and location TBD. Travel costs will be covered.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-muted">Judging Criteria</h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/the_beagle_freedom_prize_application_process">Grant Applications</a> will be judged by a panel of scientists and researchers who share the aim of reducing, and ultimately replacing animal-based models and methods, particularly for that of dogs. <br><br> The Beagle Freedom Prize will use a two-step peer-review process for selecting the most innovative and promising proposals. First, each application will be reviewed by the Beagle Freedom Science Advisory Board, which is a multi-disciplinary and standing committee of outstanding scientists committed to replacing the use of animals in experimentation.  Second, each proposal will be evaluated by at least three outside individuals with unique expertise in the field relevant to the specific proposal.<br><br> At both steps of the review process, proposals will be evaluated based on scientific merit using a similar <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/peer/guidelines_general/scoring_system_and_procedure.pdf" target="_blank">scoring system as that used by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. Proposals must also demonstrate a judicious use of funds and a likelihood that the fruits of the project will make a tangible impact on replacing the use of animals in research, testing, and/or education.<br><br><strong>The following terms and conditions apply. Please read these terms before applying for a Grant. Other terms and conditions may apply at the time of signing</strong></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">      I.         PURPOSE: The purpose of the grant discussed herein shall be to find new methods to replace the common use of dogs and other animals in research/testing/education with a non-animal method/model</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">    II.         NON-BINDING: The terms of this policy are non-binding are subject to change. Upon acceptance of a Grantee's proposal and application for grant, Grantor shall execute a final award letter setting forth the applicable terms of the grant award that are generally consistent with Grantor's operative policy. It is up to the Grantor, in its full discretion, to disburse any amount it deems fit. There is no set structure to how much Grantor shall give to each Grantee.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">  III.         RESTRICTED USE: Grant funds must only be used for the purposes set forth in Section I.  If any granted funds are used in any way that are not consistent with, or in furtherance of, the purpose of this grant as set forth in Section I, then Grantee must restore all funds received under the grant and must compensate Grantor for any reasonable expenses incurred as a result of its dealings with Grantee with respect to this Grant. </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In conjunction with the obligations set forth in the preceding paragraph, Grantee's use and control of the awarded grant funds may not, among other things, either directly or indirectly, fund or otherwise support any research involving the use of animals or any activity that is purposed at facilitating animal experimentation, testing or research.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">  IV.         PROPRIETARY INFORMATION: The intellectual property associated with this grant shall not be used (1) to limit or deny access to the Grant Work Product if to do so would be inconsistent with the goal of reducing animal testing, research or experimentation, (2) to result in exclusive use of such Grant Work Product if to do so would be inconsistent with the goal of reducing animal testing, research or experimentation, or (3) to create revenue that is not substantially related to the goal of reducing animal testing, research or experimentation. Grantor will be granted a no-cost assignable license to use or publish the Grant Work Product to further the goal of reducing animal testing, research or experimentation.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">    V.         NON-DISCRIMINATION: Grantee shall certify that he/she/it is in compliance with all laws prohibiting discrimination in employment or otherwise on the basis of political or religious opinion or affiliation, marital status, sexual orientation, genetic information, race, color, creed or national origin, sex, gender, age, or the physical or mental disability.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the grant discussed herein shall be to find new methods to replace the common use of dogs and other animals in research/testing/education with a non-animal method/model</p>
